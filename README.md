# `CVNStudy`: A Simulation Study for the Covariate-Varying Network Algorithm 

## Overview

This repository contains code for running simulations to assess the performance of the Covariate Varying Network (CVN) algorithm. The CVN algorithm is available at [github.com/bips-hb/CVN](https://www.github.com/bips-hb/CVN).

Please note that this study is a work in progress, and more content will be added soon, including processing results, creating plots etc.

This study relies on an R package under development at the BIPS for running simulation studies. You can find the package at [github.com/bips-hb/simtracker](https://www.github.com/bips-hb/simtracker). Keep in mind that the simtracker package is in very early stages of development.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```R
source("install-github-packages.R")
```

This command will ensure that the necessary dependencies, including the CVN algorithm and the simtracker package, are installed.

## Usage

The main file for running the simulations and processing the results is `run.R`. Execute this file to initiate the study. Please be aware that running the entire study may take a considerable amount of time due to the complexity of the CVN algorithm.

More functionalities, such as result processing and plot creation, will be added soon.

## Additional Information

For more details about the CVN algorithm and the study, please refer to our paper. The paper provides comprehensive information on the algorithm's performance and other relevant insights.
